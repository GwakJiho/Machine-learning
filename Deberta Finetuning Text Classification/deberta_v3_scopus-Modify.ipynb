In this context, the Kanban System is a technique that may contribute to minimise this problem, increasing the productivity, reducing wastes as well as maintaining within the set budgets. This paper presents the assessment of the implementation of kanban systems in construction sites aiming to identify improvement opportunities for a better use of the system and also to establish a set of necessary conditions for its implementation and use. A literature review aimed at studying the Toyota Production System principles and its relationship with kanban system was performed. From the literature review a checklist was created as a method of evaluation. Three construction sites in the city of Salvador Bahia Brazil that use the kanban system for the supply of materials were analysed. The checklist for evaluation includes issues related to tools and concepts inherent with the kanban system, these being: A) mechanisms for loss reduction, b) mechanisms of achieving continuous improvement, c) tools to increase communication and transparency, d) just in time, e) production and pull streaming. The main contribution of this paper is the identification of the degree of kanban system implementation on the building site studied and its opportunities for improvement. Also, the necessary conditions and guidelines for implementation were established.', 'label': 10}, {'text': \"Genotype x environment interaction for grazing vs. confinement. II. Health and reproduction traitsContinual selection for increased milk yield for more than 40 yr, combined with the antagonistic relationship between increasing yield, somatic cell count, and fertility, have resulted in sires that may not be optimal for producing daughters for grazing systems where seasonal calving is very important. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible existence of a genotype x environment interaction (G x E) in grazing vs. confinement herds within the United States for lactation average somatic cell score (LSCS), days open (DO), days to first service (DFS), and number of services per conception (SPC). Grazing herds were defined as those that utilized grazing for at least 6 mo each year and were enrolled in Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI). Control herds were confinement DHI herds of similar size in the same states. For LSCS, the performance of daughters in grazing and control herds was examined using linear regression of LSCS on the November 2000 USDA DHIA sire predicted transmitting abilities (PTA) for SCS. Genetic parameters for all traits were estimated using REML in a bivariate animal model that treated the same trait in different environments as different traits. Rank correlations were calculated between sires' estimated breeding values for LSCS, calculated separately for sires in both environments. The coefficient of regression of daughter LSCS on sire PTA was less in grazing herds than in control herds. The coefficient of regression for control herds was closer to expectation. Estimates of heritability were approximately 0.12 for LSCS, and less than 0.05 for the reproduction traits. Heritabilities for DO, DFS, and SPC were slightly higher for control herds. Estimates of genetic correlation for each reproductive trait between the 2 environments were high and not significantly different from unity. Generally, these traits appear to be under similar genetic control, but a lower coefficient of regression of LSCS on sire PTA for SCS in grazing herds suggests differences in daughter performance in grazing herds may be overstated based on current PTA for SCS. © American Dairy Science Association, 2004.\", 'label': 150}, {'text': 'Basmati Rices: Genetics, Breeding and TradeBasmati rices, indigenous to the Indian sub continent and endowed with unique quality traits are palatal delights of the rice connoisseurs world over. These virtues of Basmati rices command them premium price in domestic and international markets. Over the last several decades many studies have been carried out with the aim of understanding the extent of diversity of this speciality rice as well as genetics and breeding behavior of the key traits that distinguish Basmati from all other rices. In an attempt to obtain higher yield and to introduce resistance to pests and diseases without compromising on their quality, various breeding strategies which include recombination, mutation, hybrid and molecular breeding approaches have been pursued. In Basmati rice trade, patent and trademark claims by countries and organizations outside the natural habitat of Basmati rice, and issues relating to adulteration of Basmati rice with look alike long grain non Basmati grains by greedy traders have emerged as serious issues, which were required to be countered for protecting the burgeoning trade and the livelihood of poor farmers in the Himalayan foothills, the home of Basmati. Development and extensive commercial cultivation of high yielding Basmati varieties and hybrids, which fall short of the quality features of traditional Basmati varieties, since mid 90s have necessitated development of high throughput DNA marker assay for distinguishing the traditional Basmati varieties from the evolved or cross bred Basmati varieties as well as from the look alike non Basmati varieties in order to ensure fair price for the farmers and to quantify admixtures in export consignments.

However, isolation from natural sources is usually limited by low abundance and environmental, seasonal as well as regional variation, whereas total chemical synthesis is typically commercially unfeasible considering the complex structures of most plant natural products. With advances in DNA sequencing and recombinant DNA technology many of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for the production of these valuable compounds have been elucidated, offering the opportunity of a functional integration of biosynthetic pathways in suitable microorganisms. This approach offers promise to provide sufficient quantities of the desired plant natural products from inexpensive renewable resources.

This is the reason why ITU T has recently decided to start the standardization process on NGN under the form of a new ITU T Project prepared by Study Group 13. This new Project is in line with results from the existing ITU T Project on Global Information Infrastructure (GII) because NGN is seen as a concrete realization of the GII.

The concentration of 19 PAH compounds in PM2.5 ranged from 4.03 to 102 ng m 3. When PAH inhalation bioaccessibility was assessed using simulated epithelial lung fluid, mean bioaccessibility values ranged from 3.21% (Benzo(c)fluorene) to 44.2% (Acenaphthylene). Benzo(a)pyrene concentration in 50% of the PM2.5 samples exceeded the Chinese air quality standard of 2.5 ng m 3, however, when bioaccessibility was considered, all samples were below the criterion. Similarly, the cancer risk probability for all PM2.5 samples was >10 4 incidences on the basis of total PAH concentration, while only 37% of samples posed a risk >10 4 after incorporation of bioaccessibility. Dioxin toxicity of PM2.5 bound PAHs was also investigated by characterizing mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 superfamily members in human lung cells (A549 cell). Compared to total PAH concentration, the use of bioaccessible concentration was better at predicting dioxin toxicity of PM2.5 associated PAHs (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.40 0.83 with p < 0.05). This study indicates that PAH inhalation bioaccessibility is an important consideration when assessing and predicting the risk posed by PM2.5 particles, which is particularly important for countries with deteriorating air quality.', 'label': 161}, {'text': 'Mixture loss coefficient of safety valves used in nuclear plantsTheoretical and experimental investigations on the loss coefficient of gas liquid mixture across safety relief valves have been carried out. Experiments were performed for three different types of safety valves and under different flow conditions. Using the Darcy equation and based on the presented experimental results, a new empirical correlation has been developed to calculate the loss coefficient and hence pressure loss. By consideration of flow contraction, high viscous fluids, Reynolds number and safety valve geometry, the model includes therefore the relevant primary influencing parameters. The reproductive accuracy of the proposed model and the statistical comparison, based on about 2000 measured data in the literature, demonstrated that the proposed model is the best overall agreement with the data. The standard deviation of the data is less than 27%. The model fits the data well and is sufficiently accurate for engineering purposes.

The dynamics of solar system objects, such as dwarf planets and asteroids, has become a well established field of celestial mechanics in the past thirty years, owing to the improvements that have been made in observational techniques and numerical studies. In general, the ecliptic is taken as the reference plane in these studies, although there is no dynamical reason for doing so. In contrast, the invariable plane as originally defined by Laplace, seems to be a far more natural choice. In this context, the latest study of this plane dates back to Burkhardt. Aims. We define and determine the orientation of the invariable plane of the solar system with respect to both the ICRF and the equinox ecliptic of J2000.0, and evaluate the accuracy of our determination. Methods. Using the long term numerical ephemerides DE405, DE406, and INPOP10a over their entire available time span, we computed the total angular momentum of the solar system, as well as the individual contribution to it made by each of the planets, the dwarf planets Pluto and Ceres, and the two asteroids Pallas and Vesta. We then deduced the orientation of the invariable plane from these ephemerides. Results. We update the previous results on the determination of the orientation of the invariable plane with more accurate data, and a more complete analysis of the problem, taking into account the effect of the dwarf planet (1) Ceres as well as two of the biggest asteroids, (4) Vesta and (2) Pallas. We show that the inclusion of these last three bodies significantly improves the accuracy of determination of the invariable plane, whose orientation over a 100 y interval does not vary more than 0.1 mas in inclination, and 0.3 mas in longitude of the ascending node. Moreover, we determine the individual contributions of each body to the total angular momentum of the solar system, as well as the inclination and longitude of the node with respect to this latter plane. Conclusions. Owing to the high accuracy of its determination and its fundamental dynamical meaning, the invariable plane provides a permanent natural reference plane that should be used when studying solar system dynamics, instead of the ecliptic. Since it is fixed in an isolated solar system, whereas the ecliptic alters with time, we recommend referring to it when working on long term dynamics. © 2012 ESO.\", 'label': 115}]\n",

High intensity laser beam was used for the surface irradiation of Fe Co B Si Nb bulk metallic glasses. The variable parameter was laser beam pulse energy. For the analysis of structure and properties of bulk metallic glasses and their surface after laser remelting the X ray analysis, microscopic observation and test of mechanical properties were carried out. Examination of the nanostructure of amorphous materials obtained by high pressure copper mold casting method and the irradiated with the use of TITAN 80 300 HRTEM was carried out. Nanohardness and reduced Young's modulus of particular amorphous and amorphous crystalline material zone of the laser beam were examined with the use of Hysitron TI950 Triboindenter nanoindenter and with the use of Berkovich's indenter. The XRD and microscopic analysis showed that the test material is amorphous in its structure before irradiation. Microstructure observation with electron transmission microscopy gave information about alloy crystallization in the irradiated process. Identification of given crystal phases allows to determine the kind of crystal phases created in the first place and also further changes of phase composition of alloy. The main value of the nanohardness of the surface prepared by laser beam has the order of magnitude similar to bulk metallic glasses formed by casting process irrespective of the laser beam energy used.

Protective role of antioxidant functional foodsFree radicals and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and cancer. Exercise is a useful strategy for preventing CVD but in elderly persons it can enhance oxidative stress, which is why some studies recommend antioxidant supplementation for exercising elderly subjects. This intervention study was performed on 320 elderly subjects following a Geriatric Revitalization Program (GEREPRO) to maintain physical health and reduce CVD risk. GEREPRO was based on regular exercise concurrent with a nutritional antioxidant treatment based on daily intake of a functional antioxidant food, Biofrutas™. Sustained exercise (10 months, 3 sessions/week) significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness and plasma HDL cholesterol; it reduced some predictors of cardiovascular risk (arterial pressure, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/LDL C, LDL C/HDL C), but significantly enhanced some biomarkers of oxidative stress. Concurrent antioxidant supplementation did not produce any ergogenic effects but, meaningfully, enhanced some positive effects of exercise on physical health and the CDV risk index, and it totally prevented the exercise induced oxidative stress. Our results show that regular and moderate exercise improves cardiorespiratory function and reduces CVD risk in elderly people, while concurrent antioxidant supplementation modulates oxidative insult during exercise in the elderly and enhances the beneficial effects of exercise. © 2006 IUBMB/IOS Press and the authors.

Cholesterol saturates the bulk phospholipid bilayer and induces formation of immiscible cholesterol bilayer domains (CBDs) within the membrane. Our results (based on EPR spin labeling experiments with lens lipid membranes), along with a literature search, have allowed us to identify the significant functions of cholesterol specific to the fiber cell plasma membrane, which are manifest through cholesterol membrane interactions. The crucial role is played by the CBD. The presence of the CBD ensures that the surrounding phospholipid bilayer is saturated with cholesterol. The saturating cholesterol content in fiber cell membranes keeps the bulk physical properties of lens lipid membranes consistent and independent of changes in phospholipid composition. Thus, the CBD helps to maintain lens membrane homeostasis when the membrane phospholipid composition changes significantly. The CBD raises the barrier for oxygen transport across the fiber cell membrane, which should help to maintain a low oxygen concentration in the lens interior. It is hypothesized that the appearance of the CBD in the fiber cell membrane is controlled by the phospholipid composition of the membrane. Saturation with cholesterol smoothes the phospholipid bilayer surface, which should decrease light scattering and help to maintain lens transparency. Other functions of cholesterol include formation of hydrophobic and rigidity barriers across the bulk phospholipid cholesterol domain and formation of hydrophobic channels in the central region of the membrane for transport of small, nonpolar molecules parallel to the membrane surface. In this review, we provide data supporting these hypotheses. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.', 'label': 166}, {'text': 'Airport quality and productivity changes: A Malmquist index decomposition assessmentThey should invest more resources in an effort to reduce passenger waiting time.

The dominant smolt age of wild post smolts was 2 years, followed by 1 and 3 year old fish, and a few 4 year old fish. The average rate of circulus formation in the marine zone of scales was estimated to be 6.3 d circulus 1. Both the age structure and the number of marine circuli in the scales suggest that the majority of the post smolts originated in rivers in southern Europe. Applying intercirculi distances in scales as a proxy variable of growth rate suggests that putative marine growth rates varied among years, with the fastest growth rates in 2002 and the slowest growth rates in 2008. Further, the first marine intercirculi distances were narrowest in 1 year old smolts, successively increasing with smolt age, indicating that growth rates during the first period at sea were lowest for salmon of southernmost origin.

But there is relatively poor understanding of vacancy clusters, mainly due to the inadequacy of present techniques to profile and especially to count vacancy defects. Recently, two important steps have been taken in the direction of understanding the vacancy type defects. The first is the demonstration that high energy ion implantation (HEI) can be used as a vacancy implanter to introduce vacancies (V) in Si that are separated from the interstitials (I) by relying on spatial separation of the Frenkel pairs due to the average forward momentum of the recoils. The second is the development of two techniques, Au labeling and cross section X ray microbeam diffuse scattering, which permit quantitative measurements of the vacancy type defect clusters and their depth distribution. In this work we highlight the Au labeling technique and use the vacancy implanter in conjunction with Au labeling to study the evolution of excess vacancy defects (Vex) created by HEI of Si+ in Si(100) as a function of fluence and temperature. We show that a precise injection of Vex is possible by controlling implanted fluence . We also show that the Vex clusters formed by the HEI are extremely stable and their annihilation is governed by interstitial injection rather than vacancy emission in the temperature range of 800 900°C. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.', 'label': 103}, {'text': 'Defining the GIG coreThe Global Information Grid (GIG) is a large and complex undertaking that is intended to integrate virtually all of the information systems, services, and applications in the US Department of Defense (DoD) into one seamless, reliable, and secure network. In order to achieve the GIG vision of ubiquitous and reliable communications, the GIG will need to support mobility, security and survivability over a core infrastructure built from components of different services and organizations within the US. This paper defines a number of concepts associated with the GIG and discusses two architectural options for constructing the core of the GIG: the striped core and the black core. In all cases, we assume traffic flows are protected in the core using IPsec or similar protocols. While a striped network simplifies the interconnection of core component by making traffic visible at the interconnection point, decrypting and re encrypting to allow interconnection of core components complicates the end to end problem of IPsec gateway discovery, of network routing and of quality of service. As well, decrypting at intermediate nodes compromises the protection of traffic afforded by end to end IPsec encryption.

As an example, a cylindrical Li ion cell with LiFePO4 as cathode material (LiFePO4 cell) is analyzed in detail both experimentally and by means of spatial electro thermal co simulations. The reason for current density inhomogeneities is found to be the local electrochemical impedance varying with temperature in different regions of the jelly roll. For the investigated cell, high power cycling and the resulting temperature gradient additionally cause SoC gradients inside the jelly roll. The local SoCs inside one cell diverge firstly because of asymmetric current density distributions during charge and discharge inside the cell and secondly because of the temperature dependence of the local open circuit potential. Even after long relaxation periods, the SoC distribution in cycled LiFePO4 cells remains inhomogeneous across the jelly roll as a result of hysteresis in the open circuit voltage. The occurring thermal electrical inhomogeneities are expected to influence local aging differences and thus, global cell aging. Additionally the occurrence of inhomogeneous current flow and SoC development inside non uniformly cooled battery packs of parallel connected LiFePO4 cells is measured and discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

By civil engineering we include on one hand the flood defenses, able to increase the flood risk in case of failures, on the other hand the urban technical networks able to spread the flood risk in cities. From history, most of cities in the world have been built close to coast lines or to river to beneficiate this means of communication and trade. Step by step, to avoid being flooded, defenses like levees have been built. The capacity of the levees to retain the floods depends on their conditions, their performance level and the capacity of the authorities to well maintain these infrastructures. Then, in case of levee break, cities will be flooded. The urban technical networks, due to the way they have been designed, their conditions and their locations in the city, will play a major role in the diffusion of the flood extent. Also, the flood risk will have consequences in some not flooded neighborhoods due to networks collapses.

In this work we present a preliminary model of nitrogen loads from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) aquaculture in lower Spencer Gulf, South Australia. The model was developed based on feed inputs, estimates of fish metabolism and environmental data. Two pens were monitored over a full grow out season to determine nitrogen sedimentation fluxes, remineralization at the sediment water interface and accumulation in the sediments. The model suggests that the high metabolic rates of tuna lead to low retention of nitrogen in fish tissues (7 12% of feed inputs) and high environmental losses (260 502 kg N tonne 1 growth). Considering Australian annual production of 4380 tonnes over initial stocked biomass, total loads can reach 1137 tonnes N per year, 86 92% lost as dissolved wastes.

As shown by numerous reports, Drosophila is able to establish simple forms of appetitive and aversive olfactory associations at both larval and adult stages. Whereas most adult studies on aversive learning employed electric shock as a negative reinforcer, larval paradigms essentially utilized gustatory stimuli to create negative associations, a discrepancy that limits the comparison of data. To overcome this drawback, we critically revisited larval odor electric shock conditioning. First, we show that lithium chloride (LiCl), which was used in all previous larval electric shock paradigms, is not required per se in larval odor electric shock learning. This is of considerable practical advantage because beside its peculiar effects LiCl is attractive to larvae at low concentration that renders comparative learning studies on genetically manipulated larvae complicated. Second, we confirm that in both a 2 odor reciprocal and a 1 odor nonreciprocal conditioning regimen, larvae are able to associate an odor with electric shock. In the latter experiments, initial learning scores reach an asymptote after 5 training trials, and aversive memory is still detectable after 60 min. Our experiments provide a comprehensive basis for future comparisons of larval olfactory conditioning reinforced by different modalities, for studies aimed at analyzing odor electric shock learning in the larva and the adult, and for investigations of the cellular and molecular substrate of aversive olfactory learning in the simple Drosophila model. © The Author 2010.

A refined theoretical boundary layer flow solver is implemented to compute the intraglottal pressures, providing a more realistic description of the flow than the standard one dimensional, inviscid Bernoulli flow solution. Vocal fold dynamics are investigated for subglottal pressures of 0.6 < ps < 1.5 kPa and tension asymmetries of 0.5 < Q < 0.8. As tension asymmetries become pronounced the asymmetric flow incites nonlinear behavior in the vocal fold dynamics at subglottal pressures that are associated with normal speech, behavior that is not captured with standard Bernoulli flow solvers.

Our previous studies showed that several Chinese herbs could improve HPA axis function. In this study, we evaluated the antiinflammatory effects of BuShenYiQi granule (BSYQ), a Chinese herbs formula, in AD mice and explored the effective mechanism from regulation of HPA axis. Methods: The ovalbumin (OVA) induced AD mice model were established and treated with BSYQ. We evaluated dermatitis score and histology analysis of dorsal skin lesions, meanwhile, serum corticosterone (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and inflammatory cytokines were determined by ELISA. The changes of CRH/proopiomelanocortin(POMC) axis elements, corresponding functional receptors and crucial genes of glucocorticosteroidogenesis in the skin were measured by quantitative real time PCR and western blot, respectively. Results: The symptoms and pathological changes in skin of AD mice were significantly improved and several markers of inflammation and allergy descended obviously after BSYQ treatment. We found that AD mice had insufficient central HPA tone, but these conditions were markedly improved after BSYQ treatment. The AD mice also showed a disturbed expression of skin HPA. In lesion skin of AD mice, the mRNA and protein expressions of CRH decreased significantly, on the contrary, POMC and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) increased markedly, meanwhile, NR3C1 (mouse GR), CRHR2 and 11 hydroxylase type 1(CYP11B1) were reduced locally.

Methods: A cross sectional explorative study used as its main method interviews conducted in 2012 2013 among educators of dental hygienists in Finland. Leading representatives of dental hygienist training at all vocational health institutes, dental schools and centres of health education were asked to participate in the study. The interviews consisted of two parts: a self administered questionnaire and a semi structured interview. The qualitative data were analysed with thematic analysis. The inductive theoretical approach served to categorize the data based on emergent themes and patterns. Results: The educators held a general respect and appreciation for the dental hygienist profession. They felt that dental hygienists’ skills ought to see more use in orthodontics and in preventive care than is customary today, including in tobacco prevention and smoking cessation as well as in dietary instruction among adults. The traditional role of the dental hygienist and the evolving scope of dental practice seemed mismatched. Concern about the lack of clarity regarding the division of labour in clinical practice was expressed. The respondents were convinced of that the division of labour in the public sector differs from that in the private sector. Conclusion: The educators thought that the role of the dental hygienist and the evolving scope of dental practice were partly mismatched.

We provide evidence that IFN α induces phosphorylation of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) protein on Ser67. This IFN α dependent phosphorylation is mediated by either the p70 S6 kinase (S6K) or the p90 ribosomal protein S6K (RSK) in a cell type specific manner. IFN dependent phosphorylation of PDCD4 results in downregulation of PDCD4 protein levels as the phosphorylated form of PDCD4 interacts with the ubiquitin ligase ß TRCP (ß transducin repeat containing protein) and undergoes degradation. This process facilitates IFN induced eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) activity and binding to translation initiation factor eIF4G to promote mRNA translation. Our data establish that PDCD4 degradation ultimately facilitates expression of several ISG protein products that play important roles in the generation of IFN responses, including IFN stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), p21WAF1/CIP1, and Schlafen 5 (SLFN5). Moreover, engagement of the RSK/PDCD4 pathway by the type I IFNR is required for the suppressive effects of IFN α on normal CD34+ hematopoietic precursors and for antileukemic effects in vitro. Altogether, these findings provide evidence for a unique function of PDCD4 in the type I IFN system and indicate a key regulatory role for this protein in mRNA translation of ISGs and control of IFN responses. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.', 'label': 188}, {'text': \"Can the theoretical fitting of the proton nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (proton NMRD) curves of paramagnetic complexes be improved by independent measurement of their self diffusion coefficients?The self diffusion (Dc) coefficients of various lanthanum(III) diamagnetic analogues of open chain and macrocyclic complexes of gadolinium used as MRI contrast agents were determined in dilute aqueous solutions (3 31 mM) by pulsed field gradient (PFG) high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy. The self diffusion coefficient of H2O (Dw) was obtained for the same samples to derive the relative diffusion constant, a parameter involved in the outersphere paramagnetic relaxation mechanism.

Can fisheries management succeed in achieving multiple objectives? A case study of Lake Victoria, East AfricaFisheries policies often pursue multiple objectives, which may, in some instances, be in conflict or competition with each other. It may not be possible, for example, to create or maintain employment and generate increasing volumes of revenue for government whilst also sustaining stocks and biodiversity. Two approaches to fisheries management, one focused on capturing wealth and limiting access and the other on maintaining access for employment and providing community development and welfare, present contrasting policy advice, with different points of emphases and objectives. This article examines the case of Lake Victoria, where the three main commercial fisheries are seen to contribute to different objectives for the lake's fisheries. Insights from the debate between wealth based and welfare based approaches to fisheries management provide a framework for the analysis of fisheries policy and practice on the lake. From the analysis, it is concluded that whilst there is much rhetoric in support of a wealth based approach, this has not been followed through in implementation, reflecting the lack of political support for new taxation and limiting access. The welfare functions of the fisheries are significant, but could be substantially strengthened through greater investment in the provision of services to fisheries communities. The approaches are not mutually exclusive, but pursuing wealth based management must support livelihoods, employment and development, as well as fisheries management objectives. Without the incorporation of welfare objectives, fisheries policies will not be politically accepted or fully implemented, suggesting the need for a balance between wealth and welfare objectives and measures. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\", 'label': 105}, {'text': 'Developing and using evidence to improve rehabilitation practiceThe Clinical Practice Committee of the American Congress of Rehabilitation sponsored this supplement to address 2 critical, related issues for the rehabilitation field: how to develop clinical rehabilitation research to generate useful, high quality evidence and how to use evidence to improve rehabilitation practice.

It is a natural generalization of the models of graphs used by Flajolet, Knuth and Pittel [11] and Janson, Knuth, Łuczak and Pittel [16]. The present paper follows the same general approach based on analytic combinatorics. We show that many analytic tools developed for the analysis of graphs can be extended surprisingly well to non uniform hypergraphs. More specifically, we analyze their typical structure before and near the birth of the complex components, that are the connected components with more than one cycle. We derive the asymptotic number of sparse connected hypergraphs as their complexity, defined as the excess, increases. Although less natural than the number of edges, this parameter allows a precise description of the structure of hypergraphs.

Since the engineering of these plants is relatively new, control of the thermal energy storage system is currently achieved in manual or semiautomatic ways, controlling its variables with proportional integral derivative (PID) regulators. Once the plant is running, it is very difficult to obtain permission to try new control strategies. Hence, most plants keep running on these simple, sometimes inefficient control algorithms. This paper explores the results obtained with different control strategies implemented on a complete model of energy storage systems based on molten salt. The results provided by the model allow the optimum control strategy to be selected.

The microstructures, phase compositions and worn surface morphologies of the coatings were observed by optical microscope, X ray diffractometer and SEM respectively. The wear mechanism of the cladding was discussed as well. The results show that the coating deposited by modified arc spraying consisted of Fe Cr, Fe Ni and WC particles and mechanically bonded with the substrate. The remelted cladding is compact with fewer defects and metallurgical bonded with the substrate. The cladding with 35 wt %WC whose wear mass loss is minimum has the best wear resistance. Its dominant wear mechanism is mainly slight cutting and spalling.

Methods: A longitudinal observational study was conducted to examine changes in weight, dietary intake, and other health related behaviors among first year college students (n = 186) attending a public University in the western United States. Weight was measured at the beginning and end of fall semester (August December 2005). Participants completed surveys about dietary intake, physical activity and other health related behaviors during the last six months of high school (January June 2005) in August 2005 and during their first semester of college (August December 2005) in December 2005. Results: 159 students (n = 102 women, 57 men) completed both assessments. The average BMI at the baseline assessment was 23.0 (standard deviation (SD) 3.8). Although the average amount of weight gained during the 15 week study was modest (1.5 kg), 23% of participants gained 5% of their baseline body weight. Average weight gain among those who gained 5% of baseline body weight was 4.5 kg. Those who gained 5% of body weight reported less physical activity during college than high school, were more likely to eat breakfast, and slept more than were those who did not gain 5% of body weight. Conclusion: Almost one quarter of students gained a significant amount of weight during their first semester of college.

Solid surfaces were obtained by sputtering molybdenum and aluminum over silicon wafer substrates. Bottom up method based on vapor condensation technique was used to deposit the fluid upon the evaluated solid surfaces. Force Distance curves showed that liquid initially disposed over all the substrates as an extremely thin, full coating, film with an apparent variable depth depending upon the evaluated solid substrates. This layer appeared to be extremely adherent and showed the features of a gel instead behaving as a proper liquid. By going on with the fluid condensation process and increasing the total amount of deposited fluid we observed the formation of nanodrops lying on and coexisting with the previously deposited film. Drop contact angles values were found characteristic of the specific solid substrate and appeared indeed to be inversely proportional to the first deposited film thickness. The fluid deposition processes were prolonged up to reach micrometric sized dimensions where the gel like features disappeared and typical liquid features appeared. In order to reveal the status of the original nanometric liquid layer several micrometric sized drops were therefore partially or totally removed from the substrate with AFM tips. It was found that no apparent mixing occurred between these two different conditions of the same deposited fluid. To deeply explore the features of this ice like early deposited film and to detect if the observed behavior should be more dependent upon the surface roughness or surface energetic the same samples underwent fluid vapor exposures after being treated with low surface energy silanes that created a monolayer coating. These surfaces showed a completely different behaviour. A huge formation of very similar nano drops was immediately observed. The performed analysis shows that at the nano scale the Young Equation does not apply satisfactorily, even in the case of extremely flat inert surfaces in contact with an inert and non polar liquid featured as a quite common basis for biological applications. © 2009 IEEE NANO Organizers.', 'label': 62}, {'text': 'Multiple management strategies to control selectivity on parrotfishes harvestingSmall scale fisheries are exploiting large numbers of parrotfishes from Brazilian reefs, leading to significant changes in the community structure. Specifically, three now vulnerable species, Scarus trispinosus (Valenciennes, 1840), Sparisoma frondosum (Agassiz, 1831) and Sparisoma axillare (Steindachner, 1878), have been intensively targeted on the Brazilian northeast, although little is known about such fisheries. The vulnerable status of these species has brought about the need to officially regulate their fisheries. Here, the effects of different gear types on the fishing of these three species are analyzed regarding catch composition, size and species selectivity. Landings of gillnet, speargun, and handline fishing were sampled during one year, when information of each fishery operation and size frequencies of fishes caught were recorded. Gillnets are the least selective gear, catching a greater proportion of immature individuals of S.\\xa0trispinosus. Handline showed the lowest values of capture per unit effort (CPUE) and only caught S.\\xa0axillare and S.\\xa0frondosum above the size at first maturity; it did not catch S.\\xa0trispnosus. Speargun is the only gear that caught a higher proportion of mature individuals of S.\\xa0trispinosus, which by no means should exempt it from further regulations, as it is important to assure that neither immature nor exceptionally large individuals are removed from the population.

In kidneys from nontransgenic mice, 2 chloro N 6 cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA; highly selective A 1 receptor agonist) increased renal vasoconstriction induced by norepinephrine (P = 0.0008; n = 28). In kidneys from A 1AR/the response to norepinephrine was attenuated and the ability of CCPA to enhance responses to norepinephrine was abolished. In conclusion, adenosine formed during RSNS enhances the postjunctional effects of released norepinephrine by activating A 1 receptors. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.\", 'label': 95}, {'text': 'The role of surface energy of technical polymers in serum protein adsorption and MG 63 cells adhesionPolymeric materials are widely used as supports for cell culturing in medical implants and as scaffolds for tissue regeneration. However, novel applications in the biosensor field require materials to be compatible with cell growth and at the same time be suitable for technological processing. Technological polymers are key materials in the fabrication of disposable parts and other sensing elements. As such, it is essential to characterize the surface properties of technological polymers, especially after processing and sterilization. It is also important to understand how technological polymers affect cell behavior when in contact with polymer materials. Therefore, the aim of this research was to study how surface energy and surface roughness affect the biocompatibility of three polymeric materials widely used in research and industry: poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, and poly(dimethylsiloxane). Glass was used as the control material. From the Clinical Editor: Polymeric materials are widely used as supports for cell culturing in medical implants and as scaffolds for tissue regeneration. The aim of this research is to study how surface energy and surface roughness affect the biocompatibility of three polymeric materials widely used in research and industry: poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), polystyrene (PS), and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Five acute hospitals in Victoria, Australia participated in this study. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had suffered an acute severe stroke (Mobility Scale for Acute Stroke≤15). Physiotherapists assessed patients on day 3 poststroke, collecting demographic information and information relating to their prestroke status, social status and current status. Stepwise logistic regression modelling was used to examine the association between age, type of stroke, prestroke living situation, comorbidities, availability of carer on discharge, current mobility, bladder continence, bowel continence, cognition and communication and the dependent variable, discharge destination (rehabilitation/other). The resulting model was analysed using hierarchical logistic regression with hospital unit as the clustering variable. Of the 108 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 70 (64.8%) were discharged to rehabilitation. The variables independently associated with discharge to rehabilitation were younger age [odds ratio (OR)=0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.83 0.95, P=0.001], independent premorbid functional status (OR=14.92, 95% CI=2.43 91.60, P=0.004) and higher level of current mobility (OR=1.31, 95% CI=1.02 1.66, P<0.03). The multilevel model estimated that 12% of the total variability in discharge destination was explained by differences between the hospital units (ρ=0.12, 95% CI=0.02 0.55, P=0.048). The results indicate that the variables associated with discharge to rehabilitation following severe stroke are younger age, independent prestroke functional status and higher level of current mobility. In addition, organizational factors play a role in selection for rehabilitation, suggesting inequity in access for this patient group. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.', 'label': 192}, {'text': 'Using ICT to Support Individual Guidance in Health Promotion Programs for Increased Physical ActivityIntroduction: We report on experiences in implementing a system to support the individual guidance of training in health promotion programs aiming to increase participants regular level of physical activity. Methods: We used an iterative development approach considering data privacy and security aspects, followed by a phase of field testing and continuous further development. Results: Our preliminary results comprise identified clinically relevant parameters, suitable data collection methods, experienced privacy and security challenges and a glance on our developed prototype system. Discussion: We consider our results to be of interest for others doing related research. The most important requirements for a simple supporting system can be fulfilled with established solutions in the short run. A more adaptable and flexible system with an increased level of support in analysing the data, which we aim to achieve, leads to currently open research challenges.', 'label': 70}, {'text': \"Considerations for cost of ownership in EUV lithographyThe cost of ownership of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is typically addressed in terms of raw utility consumption. Focusing on energy, the average consumption of a typical semiconductor fabrication plant has doubled over a recent 10 year period, with approximately 30% of this energy currently attributed to vacuum equipment. Compared to conventional optical lithography, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) requires the adoption of a vacuum subsystem to enable the technology, bringing an additional vacuum requirement to semiconductor fabs. With this trend it is increasingly important to focus on more efficient ways of operating semiconductor manufacturing tools and their supporting equipment. Clever operation through employment of 'GREEN' modes can provide significant utility savings. However, in semiconductor lithography, tool uptime is a critical parameter to be considered in any cost of ownership model, and the facility vacuum equipment plays an intimate role here, so including redundancy in pumping equipment can be a key enabler to maintaining tool uptime. Consequently optimizing the design of the vacuum subsystem will help to reduce the overall footprint, utility consumption and energy costs associated with this process. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).\", 'label': 164}, {'text': 'World Small Animal Veterinary Association Renal Pathology Initiative: Classification of Glomerular Diseases in DogsEvaluation of canine renal biopsy tissue has generally relied on light microscopic (LM) evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections ranging in thickness from 3 to 5 µm. Advanced modalities, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunofluorescence (IF), have been used sporadically or retrospectively. Diagnostic algorithms of glomerular diseases have been extrapolated from the World Health Organization classification scheme for human glomerular disease. With the recent establishment of 2 veterinary nephropathology services that evaluate 3 µm sections with a panel of histochemical stains and routinely perform TEM and IF, a standardized objective species specific approach for the diagnosis of canine glomerular disease was needed. Eight veterinary pathologists evaluated 114 parameters (lesions) in renal biopsy specimens from 89 dogs. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the data revealed 2 large categories of glomerular disease based on the presence or absence of immune complex deposition: The immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis (ICGN) category included cases with histologic lesions of membranoproliferative or membranous patterns. The second category included control dogs and dogs with non ICGN (glomerular amyloidosis or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis). Cluster analysis performed on only the LM parameters led to misdiagnosis of 22 of the 89 cases—that is, ICGN cases moved to the non ICGN branch of the dendrogram or vice versa, thereby emphasizing the importance of advanced diagnostic modalities in the evaluation of canine glomerular disease. Salient LM, TEM, and IF features for each pattern of disease were identified, and a preliminary investigation of related clinicopathologic data was performed.', 'label': 136}, {'text': 'Defect detection and evaluation of ultrasonic infrared thermography for aerospace CFRP compositesThe ultrasonic infrared thermography Non destructive Testing is introduced for detecting the impact damage of a CFRP specimen for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The characteristics of thermal images with damage are particularly analyzed. A Local Binary Fitting (LBF) model based on a non Gaussian kernel function is used to segment the defect edge. In view of the discontinuity of defect in thermal images due to multilayered structure of composite materials, defect merging algorithms are proposed including time domain and space domain methods by using a few thermal images, and the defect geometric distortion during camera imaging is also compensated. The defect in the composite material can be quantitatively analyzed after the defect reconstruction. The experimental result has shown that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect and evaluate the impact damage of thermal images and the accuracy of quantitative assessment is correspondingly increased. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
